##  Dataset Information

 **Source:** [Kaggle â€“ Uber Fares Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/uber-fares-dataset)  
**File Used:** `Uber-Jan-Feb-FOIL.csv`  
 **Rows:** 354  
 **Columns:**
   `dispatching_base_number`: Base company dispatching trips  
`date`: Date of trip  
`active_vehicles`: Number of vehicles in service  
`trips`: Number of completed trips  

---

##  Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

Data preparation was conducted using **Python in Jupyter Notebook**.

### Steps:
1. Converted `date` column to datetime format
2. Checked for missing values (none found)
3. Generated descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, std deviation)
4. Identified and visualized outliers
5. Created additional features:
    `year`, `month`, `day`, `day_of_week`
   `is_peak` (True if weekend)
   `base_encoded` (numeric encoding of base)

### Output Files:
 `cleaned_uber_fares.csv`: Cleaned data  
`enhanced_uber_fares.csv`: Feature-enhanced data

##  Power BI Dashboard

The cleaned dataset was imported into **Power BI** for visualization and analysis.

### Key Insights:
**Weekends** saw higher trip volumes
 **Base B02598** dispatched the most trips
 **February** had a slight rise in active vehicles
 **Outliers** suggest high-demand days (e.g., holidays, promotions)
